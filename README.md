# Trump Bitcoin Report Card - Day 100

For whatever reason day 100 of a president's term has been deemed a milestone. So, it's time to check in with President Trump's bitcoin pledges and issue a report card.

### Comments
**Pledge 1** - SEC chair - (no change from earlier) - Gensler is out. This happened after the election and Trump took office. With the writing on the wall, Gensler announced he would [resign](https://coinpedia.org/news/big-breaking-sec-chair-gary-gensler-officially-resigns/), Trump picked a new SEC head in [Paul Atkins](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/trump-plans-to-nominate-paul-atkins-as-sec-chair.html), and [Gensler left office](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/01/20/it-s-official-gary-gensler-is-out-at-the-sec-and-crypto-friendly-mark-uyeda-is-in) just before Trump was sworn in. The only reason an A+ was not awarded was that Trump wasn't given the chance to actually fire Gensler, because he quit. No doubt, though, his quitting was due to Trump and the threat of being sacked.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: A

**Pledge 2** - free Ross -  (no change from earlier) - Ross Ulbricht's sentence was [just commuted](https://njump.me/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzp9s7ns8cnk82r07ztejxe2wgjklvqcgxwg8ftmeqfrs24ft670chqyfhwumn8ghj7mmxve3ksctfdch8qatz9uq3wamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwwpexjmtpdshxuet59uqzpl4m3j7j9hz2muk34xyk0u5ngu2agp7js62gpks6k3sedrzsf78u6jmdxr). Going will "option 3" above, the pledge was kept. An A+ would have been a commutation yesterday or by noon today, but, let's not split hairs. It's done.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: A

**Pledge 3** - capital gains  - This requires either executive action and/or legislation. There was no action. Executive action can be done with the stroke of a pen, but it was not. Legislation is tricky and time-consuming, however, there wasn't even mention of this matter. This seems to be on the back burner since statements such as [this report](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/trump-proposes-crypto-tax-cuts-targets-u-s-made-tokens-for-tax-exemption) in November. See Progress Report 1: https://stacker.news/items/774165 for more context.

Trump's main tax thrust has been the tariff, actually a tax *increase*, instead of a *cut*. Currently, the emphasis is on extending the "Trump tax cuts" and recently House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated such a bill would be [ready by Memorial Day](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5272043-johnson-house-trump-agenda-memorial-day/). Earlier in his term, there was more [chatter about tax relief](https://cryptodnes.bg/en/will-trumps-crypto-policies-lead-to-tax-relief-for-crypto-investors/) for bitcoin or cryptocurrency. There seems to be less chatter on this, or none at all, such as its absence in the "ready by Memorial Day" article.

Until tax reform is codified and signed, it isn't tax law and the old code still applies.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: F

**Pledge 4** - bitcoin reserve - The initial grade was a C, it was dropped to a D mainly due to Trump's propensity to [alt]coinery, and now it's back to a C-.

Getting the grade back up into C-level at a C- was a little bumpy. On March 2, 2025, Trump posted that a [U.S. Crypto Reserve](https://njump.me/nevent1qqsf89l74mqfkk74jqhjcqtwp5m970gedmtykn5uhl0vz9mhmrvvvgqpzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuurjd9kkzmpwdejhgtczyztpa8q038vw5xluyhnydj5u39d7cpssvuswjhhjqj8q42jh4ul3wqcyqqqqqqge7c74u) would be created. This is what had been hoped for, except that the pledge was for a Bitcoin Reserve, not crypto. And secondly, he specifically named XRP, SOL, and ADA (but not BTC). Just a couple of hours later, likely in clean up mode, [he did add BTC](XRP, SOL, and ADA) (along with ETH) as "obviously" being included. So, the "Bitcoin Reserve" became a "Crypto Reserve."

Maybe still in "cleanup mode," Sec. of Commerce Howard Lutnick said bitcoin will hold ["special status"](https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/policy/bitcoin-to-hold-special-status-in-u-s-crypto-strategic-reserve) in the reserve. Then, on March 6, an executive order made the [U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/establishment-of-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-and-united-states-digital-asset-stockpile/) official. Again, "Bitcoin" was generalized until section 3 where the "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve" did come to official fruition. 

The grade is only a C- because the only thing that happened was the naming of the stockpile. Indeed, it became official. But the "stockpile" was just BTC already held by the U.S. government. I think it's fair to say most bitcoiners would have preferred a statement about buying BTC. Other Trump bitcoin officials indicated acquiring ["as much as we can get"](https://cryptobriefing.com/trump-bitcoin-acquisition-strategy/), which sounds great, but until it happens, is only words.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: C-

**Pledge 5** - no CBDC - [An executive order on January 23, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) forbade a CBDC in section 1, part v by "prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC."

Day 100 Report Card Grade: A

**Pledge 6** - advisory council - The Trump bitcoin or crypto team consists of the following: David Sacks as “crypto czar” and Bo Hines as executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. 

A [White House Crypto Summit](https://njump.me/nevent1qqswj6sv0wr4d4ppwzam5egr5k6nmqgjpwmsrlx2a7d4ndpfj0fxvcqpzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuurjd9kkzmpwdejhgtczyztpa8q038vw5xluyhnydj5u39d7cpssvuswjhhjqj8q42jh4ul3wqcyqqqqqqgu0mzzh) (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/omP3GPxaVog?si=wBJUOzL0l9Rg2TnS)) was held on March 7, 2025. In principle, the meeting was good, however, the summit seemed (a) to be very heavily "crypto" oriented, and (b) to largely be a meet-and-greet show. 

Still, just the fact that such a show took place, inside the White House, reveals how far things have come and the change in climate. For the grade to go higher, more tangible things should take place over time.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: C

**Pledge 7** - self-custody - There's been a bit of good news though on this front. First, the executive order above from January 23 stated in section 1, i, one of the goals was "...to maintain self-custody of digital assets." Also, the Phoenix wallet returned to the U.S. In 2024, both Phoenix and Wallet of Satoshi [pulled out of the U.S.](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/29/wasabi-wallet-and-phoenix-leave-the-us-whats-next-for-non-custodial-crypto) for fear of government crackdowns. The return of Phoenix, again, speaks to the difference in climate now and is a win for self-custody.

To rise above B-level, more assurance, it would be good to see further clear assurance that people can self-custody, that developers can build self-custody, and businesses can create products to self-custody. Also, Congressional action could get to an A.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: B-

**Pledge 8** - end war on crypto - There has been improvement here. First, tangibly, SAB 121 was sent packing as SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce [announced](https://x.com/HesterPeirce/status/1882562977985114185). Essentially, this removed a large regulatory burden. Commissioner Peirce also said ending the burdens will be a process to get out of the ["mess"](https://decrypt.co/304395/trump-sec-crypto-task-force-priorities-mess). So, there's work to do. Also, hurdles were recently removed so that [banks can now engage in bitcoin activity](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-bank-regulators-pull-back-guardrails-bank-crypto-activities-2025-04-24/). This is both a symbolic and real change.

Somewhat ironically, Trump's own venture into cryptocurrency with his World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens, roundly poo-pood by bitcoiners, might actually be beneficial in a way. The signal from the White House seems to be on all things cryptocurrency, "Do it."

The improvement and climate now seems very different than with the previous administration and leaders who openly touted a war on crypto.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: B+

**Pledge 9** - USA mining - As noted earlier, this is an impossible pledge. That said, things can be done to make America mining friendly. The U.S. holds an estimated 37 to 40% of Bitcoin hash rate, which is substantial. Plus, Trump, or the Trump family at least, has entered into bitcoin mining. With Hut 8, Eric Trump is heading ["American Bitcoin"](https://www.reuters.com/technology/hut-8-eric-trump-launch-bitcoin-mining-company-2025-03-31/) to mine BTC. Like the $TRUMP token, this conveys that bitcoin mining is a go in the USA.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: C

**Pledge 10** - USA crypto capital - This pledge closely aligned with pledges 8 and 9. If the war on crypto ends, the USA becomes more and more crypto and bitcoin friendly. And, if the hashrate stays high and even increases, that puts the USA at the center of it all. Most of the categories above have seen improvements, all of which help this last pledge. Trump's executive orders help this grade as well as they move from only words spoken to becoming official policy. 

To get higher, the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve should move from a name-change only to acquiring more BTC. If the USA wants to be the world's crypto capital, being the leader in bitcoin ownership is the way to do it.

Day 100 Report Card Grade: C+
